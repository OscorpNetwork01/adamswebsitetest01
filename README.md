# adamswebsitetest01
This repo contains the code for one of the websites available on the bugslayer's domain, mainly for testing different features of Django.

To run, create a virtual environnement and run "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install the packages.

When it runs, the script is creating a local website accessible from the user's machine.

Features to connect it to a domain name will be explained here when they are added.

This repo is based on Django's tutorial, used as a base.
